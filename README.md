# Basic Python Console
This is a basic Python console that supports commands and custom users

## Config
The config is pretty simple, but some things can be confusing.

### Login

`loginSys` - is if you want to have a system for logging in

`userSys` - is if you want user data to be local, which enables password checking and username checking

`defaultPerms` - is unused at the moment

### Other

`sounds` - is **Windows exclusive**, it enables beeping

`sleeps` - is if you want unnecessary waits, Python can be fast, but sometimes it's *too* fast

### App Name

`name` - is the application name, it's for the app window title and it's the name that gets printed when you open the app

`showVer` - shows the version when displaying the name *not in the window title*

`version` - is the version number of the app

### Copyright

`copyright` - is if you want copyright text to print after the name

`copyrightTxt` - is the text you want to print after the name
