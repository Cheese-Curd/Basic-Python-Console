# Basic Python Console
This is a basic Python console that supports commands and custom users

## Config
The config is pretty simple, but some things can be confusing.

`loginSys` is if you want to have a system for logging in

`userSys` is if you want user data to be local, which enables password checking and username checking

`sounds` is **Windows exclusive**, it enables beeping

`defaultPerms` is unused at the moment

`name` is the application name, it's for the app window title and it's the name that gets printed when you open the app

`copyright` is if you want copyright text to print after the name

`copyrightTxt` is the text you want to print after the name

`version` is the version number of the app
